# Team apps milk frontend

## Team apps

Team apps category is a set of applications that all share the same authentication server.
The applications in the team apps category are simple applications that are to be used by a team in their office.
The applications can be various and are solely developed for fun amongst the team.

This is the first app I've developed for the teamapps category; it's a simple milk management frontend that manages who buys milk for coffe in the office :);

- Milk app service: https://github.com/Slidem/team-apps-milk-service
- Authentication server (backend): https://github.com/Slidem/team-apps-oauth2-server
- Authentication server (frontend): https://github.com/Slidem/team-apps-login

## The project

Simple front-end app developed with react, using milk-service for the backend and the team apps authentication server for authentication.

The goal of the application was not only to develop something fun (and usefull) to be used in the office,
but also to play around with **React** and learn developing **react components**, understanding the **react state**,
playing around with **javascript es6** and also with **boostrap 4**.

## Tehnologies used:

- React JS
- Bootstrap 4
- Axios library (For AJAX calls to the milk-service)
